### Hi there 👋
I am a Computer Science Graduate pursuing MSc. Computer Science with Specialization in AI at University of Freiburg.
I love to learn new and interesting things and want to explore, excel and develop alongside an institution/organization that offers best practices, and provides diverse knowledge in the current domain I am in, with a penchant of meeting deadlines.<br />
